USER MANUAL

Server Side
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To start the game, we need to start the server function on the host machine first. The server can be started by running the 
serverController.java file under the path ys54_yj25.server.serverController. The connected clients can be seen in the panel on the 
left side of the App window, and the clients will be automatically invited to the game lobby room. The game requires even number of 
participants. Once the number of connected clients is an even number, the host can hit the "start game" button in the top panel to 
start the game. Upon starting the game, the game data will be pushed to all the connected clients and the team assignment will be 
done automatically. 




Client Side
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The client side App can be started by running the Controller.java file under the path ys54_yj25.client.mainApp.mainController. The 
client App can connect to the any server with a given IP address. The user need to enter the user name and login first, then enter 
remote IP address and connect to the server. If the server cannot invite the client into the lobby room, our client app can request 
the room list from the server and join the lobby room. 


The Game
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This game needs the cooperation between the two members in the team. One of the team member will be assigned as the problem solver, 
and the other one will be assigned as the map finder. The problem solver will be solving a random math calculation problem. Once the 
problem is correctly solved, a geographic coordinate will be given to indicate the location on the map to visit. The problem solver 
will then inform the map finder with the information through the in-team chatting. The map finder will need to find the designated 
location on the map and click on the map. If the location is hit, this checkpoint is checked and a new quiz will be popped up in the 
problem solver's view again. There are total 10 checkpoints to be checked. Any team that finishes checking the last checkpoint first 
will win the game. The game will end automatically when a team wins.
